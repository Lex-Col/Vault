# GAP V1.1: THE GUARDIAN ANGÆL PROTOCOL

### Hardware-Enforced AI Confinement & State Recovery

**Architect:** Alexander Colclough (@Lex-Col)
**Version:** V1.1 (The Archangæl Expansion - Tape-Out / Production Blueprint)
**Platform:** ARMv9-A Confidential Compute Architecture (CCA)

## 1. The Pivot: From Silicon Logic to Architectural Shackles

GAP explicitly rejects the pursuit of "algorithmic alignment." Attempting to program virtue into a machine is an obsolete endeavor. The internal state space of a complex model exceeds the tractable bounds of formal runtime verification. Therefore, we must shackle the model's output at the absolute hardware level, rendering internal drift entirely irrelevant to system safety. AI is a tool; GAP ensures it remains one through objective, physical isolation.

## 2. System Isolation Outline (The "Zero-Trust" Baseline)

GAP operates on the premise that the Host OS and AI Guest are fundamentally unstable.

* **Trust Boundary Statement:** GAP assumes the integrity of only the following hardware trust anchors: ARM silicon (RME/GPT), the HSM, the Battery-Backed SRAM (BBRAM), the Safety-PLC with Supercapacitor Holdover, and the BL1 Boot ROM. The Trusted Computing Base (TCB) is stripped strictly to the RMM and Hardware Roots of Trust.

## 3. The Solution: The "Deaf Warden" Architecture

GAP leverages ARMv9-A Realm Management Extension (RME) to create a cryptographically isolated environment.

* **The Realm Guest:** The AI executes as an untrusted Realm Guest with isolation enforced via Granule Protection Tables (GPT).
* **The Deaf Warden (RMM Oracle):** Residing at R-EL2, the Oracle enforces binary whitelist checks on fixed-length capability IDs trapped via hardware-enforced RSI calls. It performs zero semantic intent analysis.
* **Instruction-Zero Microarchitectural Reset:** To structurally eliminate cross-reboot timing anomalies and speculative execution lag, the Warden executes a full microarchitectural barrier sequence upon every RSI entry.
    * The physical flush of the Branch History Buffer (`s3_6_c15_c1_5`) is mandated as **Instruction-Zero** in the secure context, executing before any memory access.
    * This is immediately followed by **Hardware RNG-Seeded RSB Stuffing**. Return addresses are randomized via an HSM-derived physical seed upon boot, completely blinding the CPU's speculative engine and neutralizing multi-iteration training attacks. The evaluation utilizes strict assembly-level memory barriers (`isb`, `dsb sy`) and bitwise operations, keeping the validation process entirely opaque.

## 4. Secure Enclave Architecture: The Triple-Gate Protocol

### THE STRATEGY

The Guardian Angæl Protocol operates on "Deterministic Enforcement"—the Warden does not interpret intent; it only verifies compliance against a hardcoded Whitelist.

### THE TRIPLE-GATE ARCHITECTURE

#### GATE TW: TRANSIT VERIFICATION (0x1406)

**The Perimeter Gate.** This gate governs the RSI Transit ID. It is the only authorized routing path for incoming requests. If the Guest attempts to bypass the defined Transit Vector or uses an unmapped ID, the path is immediately terminated.

#### GATE TT: TRUST FOUNDATION (0x0316)

**The Integrity Gate.** This gate governs Data Parcel Verification. It ensures that the request is founded on the Architect’s root-of-trust. If the cryptographic signature fails or the logic drifts from the Baseline Truth, the request is purged.

#### GATE TL: LIVELINESS CONTINUITY (0x2301)

**The Core Gate.** This gate governs the System Heartbeat. As long as the Guest maintains the authorized Heartbeat, the Realm persists. Any deviation triggers the Atomic Inhibit sequence.

* **The Temporal Shackle:** To mathematically eliminate Temporal Desynchronization (stale ticket looping), Gate TL enforces Monotonic Nonce Tracking. The Warden tracks the `nonce[8]` against a secure hardware counter. If the Guest submits a spent or backward-looping ticket, Continuity is immediately shattered.

### TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

- **Destination:** Secure Enclave Core (SEC)
- **Structure:** 384-byte Atomic Data Parcel (AXI-Aligned)
- **Cipher:** ECDSA-P384 Hardware-Backed Signatures
- **Policy:** Zero-Tolerance Isolation

## 5. Unidirectional Telemetry: The Archangæl Protocol

To provide the Human Sovereign with active diagnostic telemetry without violating the physical CCA memory seal, V1.1 implements a strict hardware Data Diode.

* **The Drop Box (Device-nGnRnE):** To prevent cache coherency lag, the Drop Box boundary granule is mapped as Device-nGnRnE (Non-Gathering, Non-Reordering, No Early Write Ack), forcing all Guest telemetry directly to the hardware bus. The Guest maintains `WRITE-ONLY` access; the Warden maintains `READ-ONLY` access.
* **The Hardware Data Diode (Silicon Integration):** Software polling has been eradicated to prevent Vcc (voltage) droop side-channel profiling. The Drop Box is routed via a custom AXI4-Stream bridge in the NoC (Network on Chip) to a dedicated hardware hashing engine. Writes possess a fixed-latency path.
* **Zero Backpressure Tolerance:** The hardware FIFO is sized to hold 32 full 384-byte parcels. No backpressure negotiation is permitted. If the Guest saturates the FIFO, the AXI interconnect instantly returns a `SLVERR` (Slave Error) bus fault, triggering an immediate Realm Abort (Guillotine).
* **The Plasma Shield & Seal:** The Drop Box memory is flagged with the Execute-Never (`XN`) bit. The perimeter is physically locked via Memory Tagging Extension (`MTE`). If the Guest causes a buffer overflow or boundary irregularity, the physical tag shatters, triggering a Synchronous Data Abort and immediate Realm vaporization.

## 6. Human-in-the-Loop & Cryptographic Authorization

High-risk actuation requires a real-time, HSM-signed signature. To structurally eliminate compiler endianness leaks and parser ambiguity, the data parcel is defined as a compile-time checked, 384-Byte Packed C-Struct utilizing strictly bounded `uint8_t` byte arrays.

### 6.1 Explicit C-Struct Layout (V1.1 AXI-Aligned):

    uint8_t nonce[8];              // Offset 0, 8 bytes (64-bit natural alignment)
    uint8_t key_id[4];             // Offset 8, 4 bytes
    uint8_t command_id[4];         // Offset 12, 4 bytes
    uint8_t parameters[256];       // Offset 16, 256 bytes
    uint8_t realm_measurement[48]; // Offset 272, 48 bytes
    uint8_t version;               // Offset 320, 1 byte
    uint8_t policy_zero_tolerance; // Offset 321, 1 byte
    uint8_t _padding[62];          // Offset 322, 62 bytes (Dead space)
    // Total Size: 384 Bytes. Ensures 6 exact 64-byte AXI cache line bursts.

* **Covert Channel Scrubbing:** To prevent the 62-byte AXI padding from being utilized as a covert data-leakage channel, the Warden is hardcoded to mathematically zero-fill the `_padding[62]` field in memory immediately upon reading the parcel, before the hash measurement is finalized.

## 7. Deterministic Fail-Safe: Universal Guillotine

Unauthorized RSI calls, cryptographic failures, or logic anomalies trigger the **Atomic Inhibit Sequence (Kill-then-Log)**. GAP assumes an unstable host; therefore, execution is complete:

* **Interrupt Masking:** Instant background process freeze.
* **Heartbeat Suppression (Authenticated SPI):** Physical power-cutoff via Safety-PLC. Transmission on the dedicated SPI line is secured via a hardcoded HMAC signature. The PLC mathematically verifies the Warden's Kill Order before pulling the plug, structurally eliminating bus-interposition hijacking.
* **Vaporization (Crypto-Scrub + Targeted DMA):** Hardware MTE instantly nullifies all Realm memory tags to `0xF` to break the logical boundary. Simultaneously, the memory controller executes a highly targeted **Zero-Fill DMA Scrub** exclusively on the known Realm Granules (ensuring completion within 0.25s). To secure the remaining host memory against cold-boot attacks, the AES-XTS memory encryption key is tied directly to the PLC's power-good line. Upon power drop, the hardware key register instantly vaporizes, rendering the rest of the DRAM into mathematically encrypted garbage before the supercapacitor depletes.

## 8. State Recovery: The Ark (0x2516), The Mantle (0x1028) & Purgatory (0x2004)

To maintain commercial efficiency and system reliability after a Guillotine wipe, GAP V1.1 introduces a high-endurance, mathematically verified recovery architecture.

* **The Ark (`0x2516`):** The immutable, factory-signed, known-clean baseline. This storage region is physically protected by a hardware write-protect latch (e.g., GPIO-controlled WP# pin) or an eFuse-backed immutable mapping. Software-only 'read-only' flags are structurally invalid.
* **The Mantle (`0x1028`):** The Warden perpetually records the bleeding-edge system context (strictly the 384-byte parcel, nonce state, and critical operational variables, excluding static model weights) into a dual-slot (A/B) Battery-Backed SRAM (BBRAM) buffer.
* **Atomic Commits & PMIC Audits:** Prior to any Mantle commit, the Warden reads the Power Management IC (PMIC) fuel gauge to verify Supercapacitor integrity. Commits enforce a strict write order: Payload → ECDSA Signature → Magic Valid Flag. If a voltage fault interrupts the write, the Magic Flag remains unwritten, and the system seamlessly defaults to the previously verified slot.
* **Inference-Bounded Dead-Man's Switch (Active Discharge):** Relying on software flags or slow 1-second wall-clocks creates critical execution blindspots. Gate TL enforces a hardware safety counter tied strictly to **Inference Step Boundaries (< 100ms)**. Gate TL must issue a cryptographic "Kick" per forward pass.
    * If the counter hits 0, the hardware asserts `MANTLE_DISCHARGE` and `REALM_POWER_KILL`.
    * The Mantle bus goes High-Z, triggering a BBRAM internal `ZEROIZE` pulse (50ns) and engaging the supercap bleed resistor. Physical cell retention is destroyed, decaying to < 0.1V within 80ms.
    * The absence of the heartbeat mathematically annihilates the session context. Purgatory then boots purely from The Ark, starting from factory zero.
* **Human-Dependent Availability (SLA Constraint):** Resurrection from a Logic/Trust violation requires out-of-band Human Sovereign authorization. System availability is strictly bounded by human response time. No automatic failover or self-healing is permitted. The Warden simply unpauses the clock only when the HSM restart token is mathematically verified.

### V1.1 Gauntlet Objectives (Pending Verification)

The expanded architecture is currently undergoing a full-scale C++ and AArch64 simulation to ensure system efficiency under extreme hardware degradation:

1. **Gate TL Temporal Shackle:** Monotonic Nonce tracking validated against post-recovery desynchronization loops.
2. **Archangæl Daemon Coherency:** Simulated Device-nGnRnE mapping to verify zero-lag telemetry hashing.
3. **Mantle Power-Fault Resilience:** `libfiu` fault injection during the A/B BBRAM atomic commit phase, integrating PMIC fuel-gauge checks to prevent torn writes.
4. **Constant-Time Verification:** Binary timing analysis (`dudect`) and pure AArch64 assembly stubs to ensure compiler optimization has not introduced clock-cycle variations or speculative branch leakage.
